### Problem 6.1

Stability analyses can help us in trying to understand or predict the longterm dynamics of a system. Stability is probably more applicable to some systems than others; systems in which disturbance is very common may be less predictable. 

### Problem 6.3

In the predator-prey situation, if species 1 is the predator and species 2 is the prey, the sign of ${df1}\over{dN2}$ will be positive and the sign of $ {df2}\over{dN1}$ will be negative. For competion, the signs of both $ {df1}\over{dN2}$ and ${df2}\over{dN1}$ will be negative. For mutualism, both signs witll be positivie. 


### Problem 2

In chapter six $ \alpha_{ij} $ is equal to the change in per capita growth rate of species i as the number of individuals is species j is changed. 

In chapter seven, $\alpha_{ij}$ is equal to the relative effect that species j has on the growth rate of species i, compared to the effect of species i on itself. A major difference is that in chapter seven, this variable represents a relative rate, whereas in chapter six the variable does not incorporate information about a species' effect on iteself. 

Instead of this notation being used in both cases, the book could use ${a_{ij}}$ in chapter six. 

### Problem 3

Increasing the value of p increases the number of individuals moving from New York to California. This initially decreases the population of New York (if p is larger than q), but after a couple of rounds of migration, the number of individuals in the populations of both states remains constant.
